Dilution Desktop App

This offline app was created with the Python EEL library to connect the front-end (html, JS, and CSS) to the back-end work in Python.  

 
The purpose of this app is to calculate the DNA dilution amounts of buffer and original DNA sample needed to obtain the correct starting concentration of the DNA microarray assays' Oncoscan and Cytoscan.

For Oncoscan DNA isolations, if the concentration is >180 nq/uL then the app will return the amounts of buffer and DNA isolation that are needed for a concentration of 50 ng/uL.

For Cytoscan DNA isolations, if the concentration is >560 nq/uL then the app will return the amounts of buffer and DNA isolation that are needed for a concentration of 80 ng/uL.
